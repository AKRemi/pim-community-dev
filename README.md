Akeneo PIM Application
======================
Welcome to Akeneo PIM Product.

This repository is used to develop the Akeneo PIM product.
Practically, it means the Akeneo PIM bundles are present in the src/ directory.

If you want to contribute to the Akeneo PIM (and we would be pleased you do !), you can fork
this repository and send us pull requests.

Important Note: this application is not production ready and is intendant for evaluation and development only!

Requirements
------------
 - PHP 5.3.3 or above
 - PHP Modules:
    - php5-curl
    - php5-gd
    - php5-intl
    - php5-mysql
 - a PHP opcode cache (Akeneo is tested mainly with APC)
 - MySQL 5.1 or above
 - Apache mod rewrite enabled

Akeneo PIM is based on Symfony 2, Doctrine 2 and Oro PlatformÂ [OroPlatform][3].
These dependencies will be installed automatically with [Composer][2].

Installation instructions
-------------------------
## Using Composer

This is the recommended way to install Akeneo PIM.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

### Clone Akeneo PIM project with:

    git clone git@github.com:akeneo/pim-community-dev.git

Now, you can go to your pim project directory.

    $ cd pim-community-dev

### Install Akeneo PIM dependencies with Composer

Due to some Oro Platform limitations, you **MUST** create your database before launching composer.

    $ php ../composer.phar install

Note that using the "--prefer-dist" option can speed up
the installation by looking into your local Composer cache.

### Initialize data and assets

    $ ./install.sh all

Note: This script can be executed several times if you need to reinit your db or redeploy your assets.
By default, this script initialize the dev environment.

Create the Apache Virtual host
------------------------------

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName akeneo-pim.local

    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/
    <Directory /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_error.log

    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, emerg.
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Do not forget to change the "/path/to/your/pim/installation/web" to the full path to
the web directory inside your Akeneo PIM installation directory.

Now, you just have to add your host to hosts file `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost akeneo-pim.local
```

Write permission for the HTTP server
------------------------------------

You must give write permission to the Apache user on the following directories:
- app/cache
- app/logs
- app/logs/batch
- app/entities
- web/bundles/jsformvalidation
- web/uploads/product

Checking your System Configuration
----------------------------------

Before starting to contribute to Akeneo, make sure that your system is properly
configured for a Symfony application.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.

Connect to your PIM application
-------------------------------

Go to http://akeneo-pim.local/ for production mode or http://akeneo-pim.local/app_dev.php for development mode.

You can now connect as Akeneo administrator with the following credentials:
- login: "admin"
- password "admin"


Generating a clean database
---------------------------

By default, when you install the PIM, demo data are added to the database.

If you want to get only the bare minimum data to have a clean but functionnal pim,
just switch the following config line to false in app/config/config.yml:

```
pim_demo:
    load_data: false
```

Then relaunch the install.sh script with the db option:

$ ./install.sh db
